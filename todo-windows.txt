Things that could be done for windows port:

1. in options.c:
gitconfig_file = popen("git config -z --get core.excludesfile", "r");
(and other uses of popen).

If git is not installed, the following message ends up in stderr:

"'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

This is because popen() really does "cmd.exe /c git config ..." and executes
it via CreateProcess() and, I'm guessing, cmd.exe is the one printing this
message to stderr.

I could re-implement popen() in a way that doesn't add "cmd.exe"
